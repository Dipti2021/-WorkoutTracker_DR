 ## Introduction 
For this application, A workout tracker has been created for which the front end code had been provided beforehand and I was required to create the backend part for it. 

   
 ## Dependencies and Tools used
   * In order to run the app, I installed the all required dependencies using npm install.
   * The app can run through localhost or can be used through the heroku deployed URL
   * All the information is stored in the mongoDB database 
   * Then I connected the database to Mongo DB Atlas.Atlas handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing your deployments on the AWS cloud service provider.
   *  Along with it,I deployed the app through __Heroku__ web host and Configured an additional add on __MONGODB_URI__ in order to relate the code and database._

 
 ## App Presentation
 The web app created can be run either from the server using __localhost:3001__ or through the heroku link. Its representation is similar to the the images shown below
